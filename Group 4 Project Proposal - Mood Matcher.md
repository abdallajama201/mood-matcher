Group 4 Project Proposal

Project Title: Mood Matcher

Project Description: The deployed application will display a list of moods to select from. When the user selects a mood that matches their own and clicks submit, then a map and playlist will be generated suggesting an activity and music for them. Their mood history will be saved on the browser.

User Story: 

As a person who experiences different moods...

I want to find suitable activities and music to match my mood...

So that I can validate/enhance the current mood I am feeling.



Acceptance Criteria:

Given I am a user with a specific mood.

When I select my mood from a list.

Then a suggested activity/place and playlist is generated to best suit my mood.

Given a generated list of activities/locations 

When I click a preferred location from the generated list.

Then I can save the selected item and it is added to a sidebar list accessible at a later time.
