## Description:
The deployed application displays a list of moods to select from. When the user selects a mood that matches their own and clicks submit, then a list of locations, a map, and a playlist will be generated. Their mood history will be saved on the browser.
Our motivation for this project was to create a unique site with lots of colourful effects. We wanted something that the majority of people that visit the site can all find useful.
